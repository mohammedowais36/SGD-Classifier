# SGD-Classifier
Stochastic gradient descent (SGD) Classifier is a linear classifier (SVM, logistic regression, a.o.) optimized by the SGD. This project involves creating a custom dataset, splitting data into train and test, implementing SGD Classifier with Logloss and L2 regularization Using SGD, initializing weights, computing sigmoid, computing loss, computing gradient w.r.to 'w', computing gradient w.r.to 'b', implementing logistic regression, comparing the implementation and SGDClassifier's the weights and intercepts, making sure they are as close as possible, and lastly plotting the train and test loss vs epochs. Some of the libraries used in this project are NumPy, pandas, sklearn, and matplotlib.
